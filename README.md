# GTA-AlienCity
Fixes for GTA: Alien City<br>
*Tested on a Windows 7 Professional (EN) Virtual Machine with 4GB of RAM and 2 CPU cores.*<br>

***GTA Alien City.7z** obtained from [mixmods.com.br](https://www.mixmods.com.br/2021/03/gta-alien-city-anderius-repack-modloader-traducao/)* (use an adblocker)<br>
```
The site is in portuguese so scroll down past the screenshots until you find the 2 gray "Download" buttons
- Download the top one (554MB)
- It should take you to mediafire.com
```
‚ö†Ô∏èYou will also need an **unmodded** copy of San Andreas.‚ö†Ô∏è

## 1. Installing the game
```
1.1. Open GTA Alien City [MixMods].7z
1.2. Open the (mod)-folder
1.3. Drag everything here to an unmodded copy of San Andreas
      Windows will ask if you want to replace files, select "yes"
1.4. Open the (bonus)-folder and open the folders
      Drag "american.gxt" into the "text"-folder in your GTA San Andreas folder.
```

## 2. Starting the game for the first time
```
2.1. Open up GTA_SA.exe (NOT gta-sa.exe)
      Depending on which version of Windows and Visual C++ you have installed, you might get errors for some .dll files, such as MSVCP100.dll
      Just press "OK" on all of them.
      If the game won't launch, or crashes when starting a new game:
        Option 1:
            - Google the name of the files
            - You should find names of what Visual C++ versions you should install
        Option 2:
            - Google the name of the files
            - Download the .dll files and place them in your GTA San Andreas folder.
            - (Downloading random .dll's of the internet is just as risky as downloading random .exe's so option 1 very recommended unless you're running on a virtual machine.)
2.2. Toggle english subtitles on at:
      Options -> Display Setup -> Subtitles ON
```

**--The game should work now!--**<br>
*...but the unpatched San Andreas experience on modern hardware is shit.<br>
See below for content warnings, fixes, notes and a list of missions*<br>

## 3. Patching the game
**WARNING:** ‚ö†Ô∏èThis game contains porn and edgy humor. See below for fixes.‚ö†Ô∏è<br> 
**IMPORTANT:** ‚ö†Ô∏èUpdating CLEO _might_ break shit.‚ö†Ô∏è<br>
  - The download page says it's exclusively CLEO 3
  - I updated it to 4.4.4 and nothing broke but who knows?
```
3.1. Toggle ON the frame limiter
    Menu -> Options -> Display Setup -> Advanced -> Frame limiter (ON)
      (Playing without frame limiter may cause small physics glitches,
        but also softlock the game during/when entering cutscenes)

3.2. Fix the janky ass mouse
    You can fix it manually every time you play, or download mousefix.asi
    Manual way:
      - Open up task manager (CTRL+SHIFT+ESC)
      - Find GTA_SA.exe and right click it
      - Click "select affinity" and make sure only CPU 0 is ticked on
    Mousefix.asi:
      - Download https://gamemodding.com/en/gta-san-andreas/others/26842-mouse-fix.html
      - Open the folders inside the .zip file and drag mousefix.asi to your GTA San Andreas folder

3.3. ‚ö†Ô∏èWARNING FOR STREAMERS/YOUTUBERS‚ö†Ô∏è
      This game contains porn and edgy humor.
      To fix this, make a "skins" folder inside the modloader,
        and replace the following skins with any mods of your choosing:
      - bfypro.dff/.txd (stripper with a big ass bush down there)
      - hfypro.dff/.txd (stripper with a big ass bush down there)
      - vwfycrp.dff/.txd (alien woman with nipples out)
      - wmyammo.dff/.txd (certain german political symbol on t-shirt)
      - sbfori.dff/.txd (britney spears with mspaint tits out)
      - sfypro.dff/.txd (prostitute with see-through top)

      Some TV screens in the game reportedly have low resolution porn images on them?
      I couldn't find any, so god speed. ü´°
      OBS has a feature to add a stream delay, so you can just cut the stream if you spot anything
        File > Settings > Advanced > Stream Delay

3.4. Update CLEO (Optional & Dangerous)
      - If you want to install custom scripts, you should update CLEO
      - Get the newest version from https://cleo.li (I used 4.4.4 for San Andreas)
      - Extract all that into the GTA San Andreas folder
        - You will get a new warning for "bass.dll" every time you open up San Andreas
        - Just press OK and ignore it
      
3.5. If you want to play User Tracks, you can put them in now.
      (GTA San Andreas/userfiles/User Tracks/)
        (This mod includes portablegta.asi which doesn't use the normal "My Documents"-folder)
```

Some of the missions can get HARD, so I recommend installing these to help you out:<br>
‚ö†Ô∏èNote: You WILL have to install CLEO as per step 3.4 above‚ö†Ô∏è<br>
- Cheat menu:<br>
      - Download [https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=16581](https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=16581)<br>
      - Open the folders inside the .zip file and drag cheats.cs and cheats.fxt inside the "CLEO"-folder.<br>
- Visual Car Spawner:<br>
      - Download [https://www.gtainside.com/en/sanandreas/mods/116355-visual-car-spawner-v3-3/](https://www.gtainside.com/en/sanandreas/mods/116355-visual-car-spawner-v3-3/)<br>
      - Drag the "cleo" and "models" folders to your GTA San Andreas folder<br>
- Skin selector:<br>
      - Download [https://www.gtainside.com/en/sanandreas/mods/119973-skin-selector-v2-0/](https://www.gtainside.com/en/sanandreas/mods/119973-skin-selector-v2-0/)<br>
      - Drag the "CLEO" folder to your GTA San Andreas folder<br>

## 4. Gameplay Tips
```
The game starts off by following a linear mission structure.
This means that you can't free roam until you've completed the first ~1 hour of the game.
If you wish to just get to the free roam you can download a save file:
  All but last mission: (Folder called "–°–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ–¥–Ω–µ–π –º–∏—Å—Å–∏–µ–π")
    https://libertycity.net/files/gta-san-andreas/62266-2-sokhranenija-dlja-gta-alien-city.html
  All main storyline missions:
    https://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=14956
  100%:
    https://gamemodding.com/en/gta-san-andreas/saves/70402-save-for-alien-city.html
...and put it _inside your GTA San Andreas folder_ (GTA SA/userfiles/)
  (This mod includes portablegta.asi which doesn't use the normal "My Documents"-folder for game saves)
```

## 5. Tested Missions
```
- Prepare for some unskippable cutscenes and slow ass escort missions
- The first 7 missions are linear and you can't free roam.
- Most of the missions are on a timer and if you attempt to leave
  you will fail mission and get teleported back to the alien base
- Alot of the missions also have a SHORT timer so you might have to retry some missions.

The full game has many missions, and the main story (not including side missions) has [about 5 hours worth of content.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15ZiZr7Eios)<br>
This was just some of the missions to give you a general idea of how the game works.
